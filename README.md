GYMNI
Fitness / Gym App Concept
The idea is to develop a Fitness / Gym App to track all your Workout-sessions.

MVP:
The user should be able to create a session and add exercises to it.
Sets can be added to each exercise with ‘reps’ (repetitions) and ‘weight’. Sets can be ‘done’ with a
checkbox next to it.
Exercises can be created/edited/deleted on a different Screen where all exercises will be displayed.
- create a workout/session
- add exercises to a workout/session from exercise screen and delete them
- add/delete exercise to the exercise Screen

User Stories:

I want to add exercises from a list to my workout session, so that I can track the different activities I
perform during my workout.
I want to add sets to my exercises with details like ‘reps’ and ‘weight’, so that I can keep detailed
record of my performance for each exercise.
I want to track my progress during a workout session, so that I can view my performance in real-time

I want to track which exercises I have already done during a workout, so that I have a structured
